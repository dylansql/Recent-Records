## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

## Change Log
 Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.  

The original idea was to create a album/artist generater with given parameters of year, genre, and mood. I thought I had the right api but unfortunately I was not able to access it. Although I wasn't able to create the original idea. I thought soon after that starting my journey in SE on a smaller scale would be more beneficial. With this pivot in goals I was able to access two Api's while using the result of one to satify the arugment of another.
